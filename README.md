# Customer Churn Prediction

### Goal
This project predicts if a customer will keep their relationship with companey or not based on few indicators.

### Steps Performed 
* Import required libraries
* Load dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Traning
* Model Evaluation
* Making predictions using created Model

### Files
* [Customertravel.csv](https://github.com/srivastavaastha/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Customertravel.csv) contains the used dataset
* [Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/srivastavaastha/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb) file contains the entire code
* [encoders.pkl](https://github.com/srivastavaastha/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/encoders.pkl) was created during the data preprocessing step to save the encoding of categorical features to use them later at the time of model evaluation
* [customer_churn_model.pkl](https://github.com/srivastavaastha/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/customer_churn_model.pkl) contains the model
